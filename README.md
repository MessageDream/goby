# goby 

As we know microsoft CodePush cloud is slow in China, we can use goby to build our's. We can use [qiniu](http://www.qiniu.com/) or [OSS](https://www.aliyun.com/product/oss) to store the files, because it's simple and quick!  Or you can use local storage, just modify conf/app.ini file, it's simple configure.
